#### Why do I need this application?
Unfortunately, many users are daunted by the macOS Terminal command line. A GUI gives them more confidence in what they are doing.

#### Can I run the shell script without this application?
Indeed you can. You can export (File/Export) the embedded bash script, InstallerAppToISO.sh, to any folder (for which you have access) on your Mac and execute it from the Terminal command line.
